                    Question: What happens if an artist fails to complete an
                    artwork?

                    Unfortunately, he/she will have to pay for all the materials
                    used. But this depends on how long the artist is taking to
                    create the artwork. If the artwork is taking more than a
                    month, then that is the time when the artist will have to
                    pay for the art materials they used. However, if they have a
                    reasonable answer on why they were taking so long (e.g. the
                    canvas is large, they're busy with their work or school),
                    then that we will just let them continue they were work.

                    Yes, we have health insurance. However, we haven't had any
                    accidents for the past 2 years, so we will be decreasing the
                    fundings for our health insurance over time. Also, accidents
                    are unlikely to happen as our staff members are very careful
                    and we try our best to remove all the toxic materials and
                    maintain a clean working enviroment for our artists
                    (Everyday, our janitors do their best in cleaning our floors
                    and we also have air ventilation to lessen the smell of the
                    paints).

                    You can visit our reception and register for the classes

                    then apply directly to them. (You got this! Believe in

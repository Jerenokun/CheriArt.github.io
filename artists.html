                Hi I'm Richard M. Tastley, most commonly known as Rick Tastley!
                I'm 24 and a very passionate artist. I mainly work with digital
                art and I do a bit of cartooning. I was once in the field of
                realism, but when I realized how much time it consumes and how
                exhausting it is to get every detail right, I stopped and moved
                to digital art. Everything was way easier I'm telling you! But
                although I don't do realism anymore, I still can do it! A bit
                rusty, but my interests in new technology, digital art, will
                never destroy my skills in realism! If you're interested I do
                oil paintings and realism charcoal drawings.

                Hi everyone! I'm Jana Marie C. Turner, you can call me Jana or
                Marie! I'm 26 years old and ever since I was little, I was
                always interested in art, specifically painting landscapes and
                beautiful sceneries. Painting them has always been one of my
                best stress relievers and it makes me so happy. Dipping my brush
                on the can of paint, painting on a clean and white canvas, as
                the birds chirp and the cold breeze passes by, it feels like I'm
                in heaven, making a painting for God himself.

                Howdy Partner, the name's Bobby D. Pool, Bob in short, age 34
                and I live in Florida. As you can already see, I'm an oil
                painter. I'll do anythng you're gonna request me as long as
                you'll pay me. BUT I love painting animals the most like cats
                and dogs. Oh and what's with the mask? I had a skin disease that
                uh... let's just say it made my face uglier than a teenager with
                a hundred acnes and pimples in high school. Anyways don't worry,
                I'm a pretty calm guy, I won't hurt you. Oh and, if you haven't
                noticed, I'm impersonating Bob Ross. That man has been my idol
                ever since I entered art school. Lucky me, I got accepted,
                unlike that guy with a toothbrush moustache who got rejected two
                times. Oh boy, I wondered what happened to him

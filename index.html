                    <i>Derived from the word Charity and art</i><br /><br />
                    This is a non-profit organization that creates and sells
                    artworks. This organization also offers weekly art lessons.
                    The money gathered will be then donated to help poverty
                    around the world! <br />
                    <br />
                    However, to at least pay back the efforts that the artists
                    has exerted, 30% of the money will be given to them! We all
                    know that art isn't something meant to be rushed and takes a
                    tremendous amount of time to be able to create a piece.
                    Giving at least a small amount gives the artists a reward
                    for their hardwork and they'll be able to benefit for
                    themselves as well!

                First and foremost, you'll be needing to register through this
                website or by visiting us. Then you can start creating your
                artworks here. If you don't have any art supplies we will supply
                it for you. You can leave your artwork here and our security
                personnel will ensure its safety. Or if you want, you can create
                your artwork at home and submit it to us. Once you've submitted
                it, we will be putting in auction or sold and 30% of the money
                will be given to you and the remaining will be donated and be
                used for the art supplies of the organization. <br />As for the
                weekly art lessons, you'll be tutoring twice a week, with at
                least an hour per session and no more than six hours (may vary
                depending on the subject).<br /><br /><br />
                <span class="subheading">For the buyers</span><br /><br />
                If you're interested in helping our organization by buying the
                artworks, you can go directly to our premises and look for the
                artworks there. Do not worry as our staff members will be there
                to guide you and help you in the transactions. However, the
                selling of the artworks are only available on the weekdays from
